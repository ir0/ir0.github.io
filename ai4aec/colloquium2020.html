			<p style="font-size:15pt">The past few years a lot of discussion has been sparked on AI in the Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) industry. Despite advancements in this interdisciplinary field, we still have not answered fundamental questions about adopting and adapting AI technology for the AEC industry. In this 1st Colloquium on AI4AEC, we would like to explore if AI is ready for the building industry and focus on 3 main questions: what can we do using off-the-shelf AI technology in practice , what we’ll be able to do in the foreseeable future, and what problems we don’t know how to solve.</p>
			<p style="font-size:15pt">In two half-day sessions on August 19th and 20th 2020 that will take place online, we will examine 6 AEC topics. Each topic will be covered in an integrative manner by a team of industry and academia to overcome siloed limits of understanding. Presentations will be followed by hands-on sessions where participants and presenters will be called to further explore what was discussed with practical activities. We will conclude the colloquium with a "reflections" session on August 26th.</p>
			<p style="font-size:15pt">One of our main goals is to identify the most promising AEC areas for applying AI, in which priority we should be focusing our attention and why. From the above, the industry professionals will learn about the leading and bleeding edge of AI, including a comparison of what people can do vs machines. The academic audience will learn about how industry is already using AI, what they see on the near-term horizon, and what they would like to do but don’t have a solution in sight.</p>

		  <h3 class="text-uppercase">How can Computer Vison and Mixed Reality help Architecture, Engineering and Construction?</h3><br><br>
                  <h5><u>Abstract</u></h5>
                  <p style="font-weight:normal">Geometric computer vision has found many applications in recent years.  Highly relevant for AEC are photogrammetry and 3D reconstruction to help with surveying or building digital twins.  These 3D models have evolved from purely geometric to include semantic understanding.   Simultaneous localization and mapping, so called SLAM, often builds on 3D computer vision techniques to enable mixed reality experiences, but also robotic navigation which are all starting to find applications in AEC.  To help users navigate inside a facility, or in the wider world, image-based localization techniques are used to build the AR cloud.  In this talk we’ll cover these topics and discuss some of the challenges and limitations. </p>

			<p style="font-weight:normal">The discussion will identify how Artificial Intelligence has helped, is helping, and may help solve future problems in Architectural Design. In general, AI will be called to bridge the gap between architects' and design experts' domain knowledge and statistical patterns in large-scale data. We will discuss current AI-driven approaches for shape and scene modeling, address their advantages and limitations, and suggest potential future opportunities such as using explainable AI models in design or using AI to spark creativity.</p><br>

                  <h5><u>Abstract</u></h5>
                  <p style="font-weight:normal">The AEC industry, being rife with risk around cost and schedule, presents itself as a huge beneficiary of both virtual and augmented reality HMD technology. Being able to simulate designs or practice complex logistics virtually reduces costly mistakes and safety issues. But why aren’t job sites and architectural studios rife with users walking around with these HMDs? While highly beneficial to projects, VR and AR HMDs still manifest critical user experience issues that are hindering ubiquitous use of the technology and require complex engineering to overcome.  
<br><br>
Current VR and AR hardware potential limits for the adoption of such systems in the construction industry and beyond will be discussed. Recent efforts to improve the realism, comfort, and accessibility of VR and AR systems will be presented. 
<br><br>
For VR to be successful it needs to be integrated in the collaboration ecosystem of any project team and organization. It needs to be embedded in the daily work practice and process. Examples from the AEC Global Teamwork will demonstrate how we reimagine collaboration in distributed project teamwork and highlight transformative impacts of VR immersive experiences at individual and team level, and on product and process.</p>

        	  <h3 class="text-uppercase">A Human-Centered Perspective on Collaboration with Robots</h3><br><br>
                  <h5><u>Abstract</u></h5>
                  <p style="font-weight:normal">Today’s society is rapidly advancing towards robotics systems that interact and collaborate with humans, e.g., semi-autonomous vehicles interacting with drivers and pedestrians, medical robots used in collaboration with doctors, or service robots interacting with their users in smart homes. Formalizing interaction is a crucial component in seamless collaboration and coordination between humans and today's robotics systems. In this talk, I will discuss a journey in formalizing human-robot interaction, and how that can help advance the intersection of robotics and the building industry. Specifically, I will first discuss developing data-efficient techniques to learn computational models of human behavior. I will continue with the challenges that arise when agents (including humans and robots) interact with each other. Further, I will argue that in many applications, a full computational human model is not necessary for seamless and efficient interaction. Instead, in many collaborative tasks, conventions —low-dimensional shared representations of tasks — is sufficient for capturing the interaction between agents. I will conclude the talk with challenges around adapting conventions in human-robot applications such as assistive teleoperation and collaborative transport.</p>

                  <p style="font-weight:normal">During this session we will invite a number of participants to engage in a collaborative immersive VR experience walking through and troubleshooting a virtual building. Please see requirements for VR walk through and sign-up below. The rest of participants will be able to view on screen our collaborative VR interactions. This will be followed by a discussion with all participants in the session. The discussion will focus on two topics: (1) compare the value of the experience in immersive 3D VR vs watching the walk through on a 2D screen. (2) your interests and plans to pilot and/or deploy VR in your project/program/company.<br><br>

		<b>Guidelines and immersive VR participation requirements  - get VR-ready and sign-up</b><br>
		We will have 8 spots for the immersive collaborative VR walk through and troubleshooting.<br>
		<u>Get VR-ready by Tuesday August 18</u> - Participants who want to actively participate in the VR walkthrough need to (1) have one of the following VR headsets and a VR-ready computer: Oculus Rift, Oculus Rift S, HTC VIVE. If you have Oculus Quest no need for VR-ready computer. (2) Download and test free 14 day trial - IrisVR Prospect by Tuesday August 18 - <a href="https://irisvr.com/prospect/">https://irisvr.com/prospect/</a>
<br><br>
Sign up by sending an email to fruchter@stanford.edu no later than <b>Tuesday August 18 at 7:00pm PDT (California time). FIRST-COME-FIRST-SERVED – sign-up of the first 8 participants</b>. Your email should indicate what VR equipment you have and that you have installed and tested IrisVR Prospect software and know how to use your controllers to navigate in VR. Dr. Fruchter will email you back Tuesday night PDT - an IrisVR Prospect CODE for the collaborative multiuser session of the building model we will walk through together.  
<br><br>
We will be glad to have a second VR walkthrough session and prepare a backup CODE for a second building in case there are more participants – for second group of the next 8 participants who have signed-up. </p>

                  <p style="font-weight:normal">Through group collaboration and interactive sessions, we will explore two key takeaways from the main presentation: our current level of confidence and trust we place within our own decision making process <i>("Trolley Problem")</i> and what questions are more suitable for solving common visual problems in a project <i>("Find Waldo")</i>. </p>           
                  <br>
                  <h5><u>Robotics in Construction</u></h5>
                  <p style="font-weight:normal">Identifying current and future opportunities and challenges to deploy construction robots: This work session addresses which robots can have the most impact and in which timeframe. Interactive group sessions will discuss and share opportunities and challenges experienced when using construction robots. Groups also exchange views on what will an “ideal” construction robot product and process look like in the next 10 years and what AEC and robot tools we still lack to achieve that “ideal” state.</p>
                  <br>
                  <h5><u>Facility Management</u></h5>
                  <p style="font-weight:normal">In this session, we aim to develop a common understanding of the key barriers and challenges for why AI until now has had a (relatively) limited impact on the facility management domain. We will do some exercises on exploring what socio-technical advancement are necessary to overcome these barriers in the context of a case study building from the University of California - San Francisco.</p>
