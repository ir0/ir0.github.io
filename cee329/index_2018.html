            <p>There’s been a great buzz around <b>Artificial Intelligence (AI)</b> the past couple of years that penetrated numerous domains. <b>Construction</b> couldn’t stay unaffected; the need to increase efficiency and decrease risk in this trillion-dollar industry is perceived as a good fit for AI-based solutions. Inspired by recent advances in <i>Machine Learning</i>, <i>Computer Vision</i>, <i>Natural Language Processing</i> and other fields, academic and industrial organizations are looking into AI-fying processes such as design optimization, scheduling, documentation, safety and construction project monitoring. However, as with every new trend, there exists misconception around abilities, usage and limitations. <i>AI technology can without doubt empower several processes in the Construction domain; what it can’t do is perform magic</i>.</p>
            <p>In this course we will explore these processes and corresponding AI directions in both academia and industry. Through weekly lectures given by prominent researchers, practicing professionals, and entrepreneurs we will critically examine these directions to gain an understanding of how AI can be used to provide solutions in the AEC industry and assess the technology, feasibility and effort. Students will participate actively in discussions, submit triweekly reflection writings and present their own evaluation of existing solutions. We encourage students of all backgrounds to enroll (no AI/Construction background necessary). <b>Artificial Intelligence Applications in the AEC Industry (CEE329)</b> is offered as a 2-unit course for up to 12 graduate students.</p>
             <p><b>CEE329S</b> is a 1-unit seminar, which requires attendance at all lecture and active preparation of and participation in the discussions.</p>

	              		<u>Project Lifecycle Scheduling - Challenges & Successes</u><br>
	              		<b><i>Kevin</i></b> will be discussing challenges and successes of project lifecycle Scheduling through 7 key principals of PSPP at DPR. He has learned that a successful scheduling system relies on a planning first approach, with teams working collaboratively to develop, align and execute a plan that they trust and believe is achievable. While CPM Schedules are the company standard for all projects, Kevin believes social planning efforts and scientific, model-based scheduling has a higher probability of successful outcomes on projects.<br><br>
	              		<u>Extending construction scheduling modeling approaches with AI</u><br>
	              		<b><i>Henning</i></b> will discuss advances on using AI technologies for this task, including feasibility, effort and challenges. Current construction scheduling technology relies on a single method to model constraints: precedence. The use of precedence has enabled the calculation of critical paths within schedules, e.g. the identification of tasks for which a change in duration would lead to the overall change in schedule duration. A new AI scheduling algorithm has extended constraint modeling to include resource pools, allowing for more advanced constraint modeling as well as the ability to search the construction schedule state space. This talk will briefly discuss these topics and pose a challenge to students on how technology can be better used to identify critical paths and driving constraints.

	              		<b><u>Talks</u></b><br>
	              		<u>Reinventing construction: a route to higher productivity - <i>Roberto Charron</i></u><br>
	              		The construction sector is one of the largest in the world economy, with about $10 trillion spent on construction-related goods and services every year. However, the industry’s productivity has trailed that of other sectors for decades, and there is a $1.6 trillion opportunity to close the gap.<br>
- Globally, construction sector labor-productivity growth averaged 1 percent a year over the past two decades, compared with 2.8 percent for the total world economy and 3.6 percent for manufacturing. If construction productivity were to catch up with the total economy, the industry’s value added could rise by $1.6 trillion a year.<br>
- Examples of innovative firms and regions suggest that acting in seven areas simultaneously could boost productivity by 50 to 60 percent. They are: reshape regulation; rewire the contractual framework to reshape industry dynamics; rethink design and engineering processes; improve procurement and supply-chain management; improve on-site execution; infuse digital technology, new materials, and advanced automation; and reskill the workforce.<br>
- Many barriers to higher productivity and ways of overcoming them have been known for some time, but the industry has been in deadlock. Most individual players lack both the incentives and the scale to change the system. However, there are forces lowering the barriers for change: rising requirements and demand in terms of volume, cost, and quality; larger-scale players and more transparent markets, and disruptive new entrants; more readily available new technologies, materials, and processes; and the increasing cost of labor with partial restrictions on migrant workers.<br><br>
	              		<u>Boosting Construction Productivity using Artificial Intelligence - <i>Robin Singh</i></u><br>
	              		In the past decade, construction industry’s productivity growth has been dramatically slower than any other non-farming industry. One of the key reason for stagnant productivity is the lack of standardized process for efficiently managing construction projects and absence of real-time feedback from the construction site. As new construction projects are increasingly complex and time sensitive, it is impossible to keep track of hundreds of objects that are getting installed in the buildings every single day. Due to the lack of transparency on a job site, good and bad behaviors are often overlooked and valuable insights are often forgotten preventing compounding learning over time. Artificial intelligence based tools can have a transformational impact on construction productivity.<br>
Before AI can be leveraged to boost productivity, the construction site needs to be digitized. Adoption of BIM and smartphones has pushed digitization but capturing field information is still a manual process using laser scanners and cameras. Current processes of manual as-build data acquisition conditions but it involves a laborious and time-intensive process. By the time data- driven insights reach the stakeholder, the insights might be too outdated to have a measurable positive impact on productivity. Drones and self-navigating indoor robots are capable of capturing data more efficiently and accurately. These autonomous systems are digitizing the physical world, opening a window of opportunities for building other AI-powered applications.<br>
The digital stream of information from a construction site captured by robots and other digital devices can be analyzed using techniques such as NLP and convolution neural networks. Machine learning is a powerful tool that can be used to connect isolated data sources and convert raw construction site information into actionable insights. Using convolutional neural networks, visual systems can be taught to detect various construction components in an image from a construction site. These systems can evaluate accurate percentage progress of different stages of a construction project.<br>
Artificial intelligence is enabling the digitizing of the physical world and converting data directly into actionable insights. Real-time insights are supercharging project managers, owners and superintendents to resolve issues by reacting in minutes not months.

	              		<u>3 Practical Examples of Robotic Applications in the AEC Industry - <i>Atul Khanzode</i></u><br>
	              		DPR Construction has been exploring the application of robotics in the construction industry for the past few years. Atul will present three examples and share lessons learned from using robots on pilot projects at DPR. First pilot project is the use exoskeletons for material handling activities for their self-performed work crews. The second example is using zero gravity robot arm for drilling pilot holes in concrete slabs for anchor supports. The third example is the use of manufacturing robots for welding wall and floor panels at their Digital fabrication startup called Digital Building Components. Through these real world examples Atul will discuss the potential benefits, the practical challenges and the opportunities for robotics in the AEC industry.<br><br>
	              		<u>The Age of Human-Robot Collaboration - <i>Oussama Khatib</i></u><br>
	              		Robotics is undergoing a major transformation in scope and dimension with accelerating impact on the economy, production, and culture of our global society. The generations of robots now being developed will increasingly touch people and their lives. They will explore, work, and interact with humans in their homes, workplaces, in new production systems, and in challenging field domains. The emerging robots will provide increased support in mining, underwater, hostile environments, as well as in domestic, health, industry, and service applications. Combining the experience and cognitive abilities of the human with the strength, dependability, reach, and endurance of robots will fuel a wide range of new robotic applications. The discussion focuses on design concepts, control architectures, task primitives and strategies that bring human modeling and skill understanding to the development of this new generation of collaborative robots.

	              		<u>Harmonizing Occupant Well-being and Sustainable Building Performance - <i>Renate Fruchter</i></u><br>
	              		Knowledge workers are the greatest asset of any corporation. Environmental factors like air quality and temperature impact knowledge workers’ well-being, and influence concentration and motivation to work. Built environment research focuses on occupant comfort which typically prioritizes tangible factors, such as temperature, over imperceptible yet impactful factors like indoor air carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration levels. Well-being offers a comprehensive perspective that includes occupants’ comfort and psycho- physiological states. The accuracy of current models to predict building performance and occupant well- being is compromised by assumptions and simplifications leading to discrepancies between model results and measured performance. What can we learn by monitoring, modeling, analyzing, and visualizing the dynamic interaction between building performance and occupant well-being?

	              		<u>What is the Point of Reality Capture in Engineering and Construction? - <i>Mark LaBell Jr</i></u><br>
	              		The democratization of laser scanning and reality capture devices has created a plethora of data, one that many in the construction industry never saw coming.  The reality capture data, albeit very simplistic like most modern day technology is still very cumbersome for most to incorporate into the day to day operations of their organizations.  This presentation will cover how SSOE has been able to save their clients $2.8 million USD on reducing unnecessary site visits on their client’s projects.  Examples will show how we have improved our deliverables, reduction of errors and omissions as well as potential loss of reputation because of poor performance and rework during construction.  While it is easy to celebrate the victories we achieve with utilizing reality capture data almost instantaneously in the present, this process took many iterations, projects and years of hard work before we recognized repeatable value on projects.  SSOE Group invests in dedicated staff members focused on process improvement and working with project team members to implement reality capture techniques for each project.<br><br>
	              		<u>Seeing Objects and People in the 3D world: Visual Intelligence in Perspective - <i>Silvio Savarese</i></u><br>
	              		Computers can now recognize objects from images, classify simple human activities or reconstruct the 3D geometry of an environment.  However, these achievements are far from the kind of coherent and integrated interpretations that humans are capable of from just a quick glance of the complex 3D world. When we look at an environment, we don't just recognize the objects in isolation, but rather perceive a rich scenery of the 3D space, its objects, the people and all the relations among them. This allows us to effortlessly navigate through the environment, or to interact with objects in the scene with amazing precision or to predict what is about to happen next. In this talk I will give an overview of the research from my group and discuss our latest work on designing visual models that can process different sensing modalities and enable intelligent understanding of the sensing data.  I will also demonstrate that our models are potentially transformative in application areas related to autonomous or assisted navigation, smart environments, social robotics, augmented reality, and large scale information management.

	              		<u>Stanford’s Integrated Controls & Analytics Program (iCAP) - <i>Gerry Hamilton</i></u><br>
	              		The Integrated Controls & Analytics Program (iCAP) is an initiative to advance the development of a “smart” campus infrastructure across the University’s portfolio of facilities.  The program holistically addresses the technologies and processes that must be successfully incorporated to realize the benefits of modern concepts like integrated systems, Internet of Things (IoT), and Big Data; and in return improve building and energy efficiency, save resources and improve organizational effectiveness.<br><br>
	              		<u>Creating Decision Support Systems for the Built Environment using Data Thinking - <i>Ram Rajagopal</i></u><br>
	              		Modern systems collect data from a variety of sources, from sensors that measure the environment to information from cellphones and non-structured data. Yet, it is not always obvious how can we extract actionable intelligence from this data. The biggest difficulty is in thinking holistically and systematically about how to transform data into intelligence, including understanding the role of rapidly changing technologies, structuring data science and incorporating domain expertise. We will briefly explain the concept of Data Thinking and how it aids domain experts in finding value in data streams. We then illustrate the concept with some practical applications from the energy and construction industries.
